Normally we'd collect information about your projects using an online form,
but the CS web-site is being retired and SAFE isn't up to the task yet.  As
an interim solution the idea is that

- you complete this XML file, replacing the template content but retaining
  the structure, and submit it via SAFE,
  then
- later, and hopefully (semi-)automatically, we'll import it into SAFE for
  you in order to drive the assessment process.

This submission represents a draft specification.  Completion of the content
below is an exercise in formative assessment only: it is a way to a) explore
the viability of initial ideas, and refine these where need be, and b) allow
provision of feedback.  We therefore want a clear, concise specification of
no more than one page of A4.

If in doubt about the content of the longer sections, make sure you read the
unit handbook at

In this section, we want

1. your CS user name
   (e.g., "jl8971"),
2. your project title (even if you change this later),
3. the full name of                your Supervisor within  CS,
   (e.g., "Daniel Page"),
4. whether said Supervisor is  confirmed or tentative,
5. the full name (and affiliation) any  Advisor(s) outside CS
   (e.g., an industrial collaborator such as "Fred Bloggs, IBM"),
6. whether said Advisor(s) are confirmed or tentative,
   and
7. whether your project is of type enterprise or research (which implies you
   are also registered on the associated "sister unit").

In this section we want a high-level description of the project; the content
might include a description of what the central problem is, and any previous
or related work done to solve it.

In this section we want a low(er)-level outline of exactly what you will to
do within the project.  The easiest way to structure this is as a concise,
focused set of bullet points outlining a) the high-level objective(s), and
b) concrete, step-by-step aims that will move you towards this.

<!--

In this section we want a draft plan for execution of the outlined aims and
objectives.  This often focusses on time scales, but, crucially, you should
carefully read

http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Teaching/hse.pdf

and, where appropriate, include

a) a heath and safety risk assessment, and
b) a statement of any potential ethics implications

plus suitable contingency planning for the issues identified.
